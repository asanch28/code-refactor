# refactor-homework

This week for Module 1 our mission was to refactor code that was given to us and condense it down to a 
simpler and easier form to read.

I fixed an issue where the links at the top of the page would not take you to the corresponding location 

I edited the HTML to have less <div> and renamed the CSS classes and reordered them in a way to match the HTML file.
